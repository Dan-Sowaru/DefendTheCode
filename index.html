                    Welcome to Defend the Code!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is a small quick game made in a few days by a beginner code student of the Let's Code Programming School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is just a quick turn-based fight between you, the Player 1 character, and a scary skeleton. By clicking start, you will be brought to the game screen. The game consist of trying to defeat the skeleton by attacking him until his "Life Stat" reaches 0. To do so, each one of you will have a turn to try one action: attack, block or cure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking Attack will roll a six faced die in the background and the generated value, plus your base Attack Stat, will be you attack value for that turn, that will be subtracted by the adversary's Block Value and the result will then be subtracted from his Life Stat.
                    A hit chance die will be rolled also, to check if any of you landed their attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking Block will resign attacking for that turn to add a rolled die value to your default Block value for your next blocking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every now and then you two will restore your forces to cure yourselves and that will add a +1 on the Cure Stat. If you click cure, you spend that point and restore a random number of Life between 1 and 6.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should leave your console screen open to see the battle logs during game, if you want to.
                    Now go and break that skelly's ass!
